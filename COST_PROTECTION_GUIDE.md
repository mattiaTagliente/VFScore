# Cost Protection Guide

**CRITICAL**: Read this guide before running `vfscore score` to avoid unexpected charges.

## The Problem

A user received an unexpected ‚Ç¨12.77 bill from Google after running the scoring system. This happened because:

1. **Google Gemini API has two modes**:
   - **FREE TIER**: No charges (5 RPM, 100 RPD limits)
   - **PAID TIER**: Charges apply automatically

2. **If billing is enabled in Google Cloud** ‚Üí You're on PAID TIER (charges apply)

3. **There's NO programmatic way** to detect tier status before making API calls

4. **Solution**: We've implemented a comprehensive cost protection system

---

## Cost Protection System

VFScore now includes **6 layers of protection** to prevent unexpected charges:

### Layer 1: Pre-Flight Billing Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**When**: Before ANY API calls
**What**: Explicit warning about billing tiers
**Action**: User must confirm API key is on FREE TIER

```
‚ö†  BILLING WARNING ‚ö†
================================================================================

The Gemini API has two modes:
  1. FREE TIER: No charges (5 RPM, 100 RPD limits)
  2. PAID TIER: Charges apply ($1.25/M input, $10/M output tokens)

CRITICAL: If you have billing enabled in Google Cloud,
you WILL be charged for API calls!

Do you confirm your API key is on FREE TIER (billing disabled)? [y/N]:
```

**If uncertain**: Answer `N` and check your billing settings first!

### Layer 2: Cost Estimation üí∞

**When**: After billing warning, before execution
**What**: Detailed cost breakdown
**Shows**:
- Number of API calls
- Tokens per call
- Cost per call
- Total estimated cost (USD and EUR)

```
================================================================================
Cost Estimate for This Scoring Run
================================================================================

Model                   | Gemini 2.5 Pro
Items to Score          | 52
Repeats per Item        | 3
Total API Calls         | 156

Input Tokens per Call   | 5,000
Output Tokens per Call  | 800
Total Input Tokens      | 780,000
Total Output Tokens     | 124,800

Cost per Call           | $0.0137
TOTAL COST (USD)        | $2.14
TOTAL COST (EUR)        | ‚Ç¨1.97

‚ö† This will incur charges if billing is enabled!
```

### Layer 3: Pre-Execution Approval ‚úÖ

**When**: After seeing cost estimate
**What**: User must explicitly approve
**Action**: Type `y` to proceed, `N` to cancel

```
Do you want to proceed with this scoring run? [y/N]:
```

**If you see a high cost**: Answer `N` and verify your billing settings!

### Layer 4: Real-Time Cost Tracking üìä

**When**: During execution
**What**: Running cost displayed after each item

```
Scoring 558736 (1/52) ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ 15% 0:25:00
  558736: 42.3s (3 repeats)
  Running cost: $0.0411
```

You can see costs accumulating in real-time.

### Layer 5: Threshold Alerts üö®

**When**: Cost exceeds $1, $5, $10, or $20
**What**: Automatic alert + confirmation required

```
‚ö†  COST THRESHOLD ALERT ‚ö†
Current cost: $1.02 USD (exceeded $1.00)

Do you want to continue? (Current: $1.02) [y/N]:
```

**You can abort at any time** to prevent further charges!

### Layer 6: Final Cost Summary üìù

**When**: After execution completes
**What**: Complete cost breakdown + permanent log

```

## What If I Get Charged?

If you receive an unexpected charge:

1. **Check your Google Cloud billing console**:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
   - View detailed usage reports
   - Verify the charges match your expectations

2. **Review cost_tracker.json**:
   - Compare VFScore logs with Google's billing
   - Check number of calls and costs per call

3. **Disable billing immediately**:
   - Prevent further charges
   - Switch to FREE TIER

4. **Contact Google Cloud Support** (if needed):
   - Explain the situation
   - Request refund if charges were unintended

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Always check billing status before running scoring
- Start with small batches (10 items) to test
- Monitor running costs during execution
- Use FREE TIER for development and testing
- Save cost_tracker.json logs for accounting

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Skip the billing warning confirmation
- Run large batches without checking costs
- Enable billing unless you explicitly need paid tier
- Ignore threshold alerts
- Delete cost logs before verification

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I know if I'm on FREE TIER?**
A: Check https://aistudio.google.com/ ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Billing. If billing is disabled and you see 5 RPM / 100 RPD limits, you're on FREE TIER.

**Q: What happens if I exceed FREE TIER limits?**
A: If billing is DISABLED ‚Üí API calls fail with 429 errors (no charges).
If billing is ENABLED ‚Üí You get charged at paid tier rates!

**Q: Can VFScore detect my tier status automatically?**
A: No. Google doesn't provide an API to check tier status. That's why we have multi-layer protection with user confirmation.

**Q: What if cost estimate says $0.00?**
A: This means you're likely on FREE TIER or VFScore couldn't estimate costs. Proceed with caution and monitor the running cost display.

**Q: Can I disable cost protection?**
A: No. Cost protection is mandatory to prevent accidental charges. All confirmations are required.

**Q: What if I accidentally started a large scoring run?**
A: Press `Ctrl+C` immediately to stop execution. Cost tracker will save logs for the calls that completed. Check threshold alerts - they give you chances to abort.
