## [Unreleased]

### Added - Bilingual Translation System üåç

#### Translation Features
- **Automatic Translation**: LLM rationales now automatically translated from English to Italian
- **Translation Client**: New `TranslatorClient` using Gemini 2.5 Flash for fast, cost-effective translation
- **Translation Orchestration**: New `translate.py` module discovers and translates all scoring results
- **Smart Caching**: Translations cached as `rep_*_it.json` files to avoid re-translation
- **Batch Support**: Translations work seamlessly with batch system

#### CLI Commands
- `vfscore translate` - Translate existing results to Italian
- `vfscore translate --force` - Force re-translation of all results
- `vfscore translate --model gemini-2.5-flash` - Use specific translation model

#### Bilingual Reports
- **Interactive Language Switcher**: Toggle between English and Italian with one click
- **Side-by-side Content**: English and Italian rationales loaded simultaneously
- **Persistent Preference**: Language choice saved in browser localStorage
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows warning if translation missing, falls back to English
- **Responsive UI**: Beautiful bilingual UI with Bootstrap 5

#### Configuration
- New `translation` section in `config.yaml`
- `translation.enabled` - Enable/disable translation (default: true)
- `translation.model` - Model to use for translation (default: gemini-2.5-flash)
- `translation.cache_translations` - Cache translations to avoid re-translation (default: true)

#### Pipeline Integration
- `vfscore run-all` now includes translation step by default
- `vfscore run-all --skip-translation` to skip translation
- Translation runs after aggregation, before report generation

#### Documentation Consolidation
- **NEW: GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide consolidating installation, usage, configuration, development
- **Simplified README.md** - Concise overview with links to detailed guide
- **Updated CLAUDE.md** - Added translation workflow for Claude Code
- Removed obsolete documentation files to reduce fragmentation

### Changed

- Report generation now loads both English and Italian rationales
- HTML template updated with bilingual support and language switcher
- Pipeline now has 8 steps (was 7) with translation as step 6.5
- Documentation structure simplified from 13+ files to 3 core files

### Technical Details

- New modules: `src/vfscore/llm/translator.py`, `src/vfscore/translate.py`
- Translation uses JSON-based prompt/response for structured data
- Translation files (`rep_*_it.json`) contain metadata (timestamp, model used)
- Report JavaScript handles dynamic language switching without page reload
- Configuration validation added for translation settings via Pydantic

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added - Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

#### Core Pipeline
- **Data Ingestion**: Automatic scanning of datasets and manifest creation
- **GT Preprocessing**: Background removal (rembg/U¬≤-Net), standardization, cropping
- **Blender Rendering**: Automated Cycles rendering with fixed camera and HDRI lighting
- **Image Labeling**: Automatic label bars for GT and candidate images
- **LLM Scoring**: Gemini 2.0 Flash integration with structured JSON output
- **Score Aggregation**: Median computation with MAD-based confidence metrics
- **HTML Reporting**: Beautiful Bootstrap-based reports with embedded images

#### CLI Commands
- `vfscore ingest` - Scan and ingest dataset
- `vfscore preprocess-gt` - Process ground truth photos
- `vfscore render-cand` - Render candidate objects
- `vfscore package` - Create scoring packets
- `vfscore score` - Score with LLM (supports repeats)
- `vfscore aggregate` - Aggregate scores
- `vfscore report` - Generate HTML report
- `vfscore run-all` - Execute complete pipeline
- `vfscore --version` - Show version info

#### Configuration
- YAML-based configuration system
- Pydantic models for type safety
- Path resolution and validation
- Environment variable support (.env files)

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md
- Detailed SETUP.md guide
- API documentation in docstrings
- Example .env file

#### Testing
- Setup verification script (`tests/test_setup.py`)
- Validates installation, paths, and API keys

#### Scoring Features
- 6-dimension rubric (color, materials, textures, artifacts)
- Configurable weights
- 3-repeat system for reliability
- JSON schema validation
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Phase 2 - Planned

- [ ] Sentinel trials (positive/negative per l3 category)
- [ ] GPT-4V support for multi-model ensemble
- [ ] Advanced confidence metrics
- [ ] Enhanced HTML reports with comparison views
- [ ] Batch processing optimizations
- [ ] Logging and telemetry improvements

### Phase 3 - Future

- [ ] Web interface for report viewing
- [ ] Real-time progress dashboard
- [ ] Custom model training support
- [ ] Advanced analytics and visualizations
- [ ] Export to various formats (PDF, Excel)
- [ ] Integration with cloud storage
